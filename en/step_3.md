## Challenge: Show the Craft

As well as the name of the astronaut the web service also provides the craft that they are in (such as the ISS.)

Can you add to your script so that it also prints out the craft that the astronaut is in. 

Example:

```
People in Space:  3
Yuri Malenchenko in ISS
Timothy Kopra in ISS
Timothy Peake in ISS
```
